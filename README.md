# Ionic Hack

Ionic 2 project hack by JaeHo Song to use Angular2 framework with ionic 2.


## Work Environment

* When you do project, fork http://github.com/thruthesky/ionic-hack and use it.
    * for instance, there is a forked project at http://github.com/withcenter/sonub
    * all sonub developers should clone 'http://github.com/withcenter/sonub'
    * so, when there is any update, you can do pull request.

* Local clone should be 'ionic-hack' to avoid confusion which means, when you work on 'ionic-hack' repository, clone the project with same folder name.
    * work folder: c:/work/www/ionic/ionic-hack

# TODO

* complete templating for RWD design.
    * [loader](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEplms60Dr9U4gMCvqxjMEAbyrH5duPkifEqxuPUiYc/edit#heading=h.dtpu4gybsdzf)
* @see 'TODO' list of philgo-api REDME
* apply c:\work\angular\sonub as much as it can be on https://github.com/withcenter/sonub
    * @see angular/sonub/README.md
* let developers clone https://github.com/withcenter/sonub
* since this, fork out 'https://github.com/thruthesky/ionic-hack' and continue a new project. if there is update, submit full request.



# Installation

* npm install

## Submodule Installation

If you clone a repository which was forked, then you do not need to do 'git submodule update --init'. but may need to do 'git checkout master'.
